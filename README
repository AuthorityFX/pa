I had planned to properly interface with an e-commerce api to reliably add plugin
licenses purchased at www.authorityfx to the TurboGears2 licensing portal.  For
the interim I wrote this threaded email parser which periodically checks a gmail
account via POP, looking for payment received emails from Paypal. Emails areparsed
for licensing details and the TuboGears2 sql database is updated.
